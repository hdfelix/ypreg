// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be reference here using a relative path.

// It's not advisable to add code directly here but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.

// Read Sporckets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
